Welcome! This is my first post on my new blog using [jekyll]. 

In my first job I found myself on a JavaScript project out of chance. Although it was a slow start as until then I had rarely stepped outside the heavy object orientated languages such as Java, C# and Objective-C.
 Now a few years later I consider JavaScript to be my main and go-to language and part of what has kept me interested is how fast this area is changing, every day there are new technologies, frameworks and tools.
 I love reading about these and trying to use them at home or at work.
 
 This is where my drive to write a blog comes in. Strangely enough despite it being globally available, it is primarily for me! I intend to use it to remind me why and how to use these new tools and technologies and make it easy for me to use them again!
 "Why will it be different to the other web biogs" you might ask, well I am going to be mainly writing examples on the parts that I got stuck or confused at when reading other simple "getting started" guides. So unless it was just me having these problems "getting started" then hopefully I can help others too!

Its not all JavaScript!
I also like to play around with iOS. I have written native apps but also feel with my JavaScript expertise it may also be time to play around with some of the cross platform tools available. 
I have previously done some more backend work using C# and though I don't activly work on it at the moment. Should I feel the need to brush up on my rusty ASP.NET MVC this will be the perfect place to record my struggles and achievements!

If this sounds useful to you feel free to subscribe to my RSS feed, follow me on my (not very active at the moment) Twitter or drop me an e-mail.
